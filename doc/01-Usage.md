# Usage
 
Phinject is designed to be easy to use. 
 
The core philosophy behind Phinject is that dependency injection should be absolutely transparent to the context in which it is used. All configuration takes place in stand-alone configuration files, and except for the bootstrap phase of the container, you should not need to reference the container anywhere in your code.
 
## Hello world
 
This contrived example will show you how to create a simple dependency injection container and how to use it.

Create file named `HelloWorld.php` and add the following code:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

class HelloWorld
{

    private $message;
    
    public function __construct($message)
    {
        $this->message = $message;
    }
    
    public function getMessage()
    {
        return $this->message;
    }
}
```

Without a container, you probably would use the following code to create the class and print a message to console:

```php

$helloWorld = new HelloWorld('hello world');

echo $helloWorld->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;

```

While this approach is fine, as your application increases in complexity, it will get very cumbersome to inject all parameters in all classes. Additionnaly, it requires extra logic to customize the injected values depending on your environment.

In order to solve this problem, developpers use a dependency injection container that contains all the parameters for your application, as well as the creation logic of your objects.

In order to use Phinject, you need a configuration file. So go ahead and add the file `phinject.yml` to your project, in the same folder as `HelloWorld.php`:

```yaml
parameters:
    helloWorld: 'Hello DI world !'
    
classes:
    helloWorldObject:
        class: \HelloWorld
        arguments: [ '%helloWorld' ]
```

The first section, `parameters`, defines all scalar values that are parameters to be injected in your classes. Here we only have a single parameter, named `helloWorld` with the value `Hello DI world !`.

The second section, `classes`, defines the objects you want to create. Here, we create an object that will be referenced by the key `helloWorldObject`, and we define its class and constructor arguments. 

Notice the `%` in front of `helloWorld` in the arguments array. The `%` tells our container that `helloWorld` is a parameter reference, and that it must use the value we previously defined in parameters. But we'll get back to that later.

Now add the following code to your `HelloWord.php` file, at the of the file:

```php

$container = \Aztech\Phinject\ContainerFactory::create('./phinject.yml');
$helloWorld = $container->get('helloWorldObject');

echo $helloWorld->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
```

When you run the `HelloWorld.php`, your code will print:

```
Hello DI world !
```

And voil√†, you've succesfully an object container with Phinject.
